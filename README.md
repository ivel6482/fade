# Fade (Back-end/API)
** This repository is for Fade's API **

Fade is a appointment/social media application for barbershops and their customers. In this application the barber can post their available appointments and the user can make an appointment or cancel them. Customer have the ability to see the haircut price and make payments using the application. Barbers can post their haircut pictures and users can make comments and upvote them.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, JsonWebTokens, Passport.js, TODO: Add more.

The server uses Express to handle request and communicated via controllers to a MongDB database using Mongoose. Authentication and authorization are handled by Passport.js.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to use Passport for authentication and authorization using jwt and Facebook OAuth as well as Google OAuth.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
